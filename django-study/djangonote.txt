Database setup¶
Creating models
polls/models.py¶
from django.db import models


class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
Activating models¶
That small bit of model code gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:

Create a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.
Create a Python database-access API for accessing Question and Choice objects.
But first we need to tell our project that the polls app is installed.


$python manage.py makemigrations polls

The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL:

$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

python manage.py migrate
Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
